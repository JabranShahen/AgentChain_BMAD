# Project Structure Summary

- **Repository type:** Monolith (user confirmed a single cohesive documentation focus despite multiple folders)
- **Primary classification:** Web-heavy automation platform combining agent orchestration (.NET/agent APIs) with a Vite-based UI and Codex runner.
- **Root path:** C:\Users\Jabra\Documents\GitHub\AgentChain\AgentChain_BMAD
- **Key indicators matched:** `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.js`, `AgentChain_UI/src/`, `AgentChain_API/*.sln`, `AgentChain_Codex/Program.cs`
- **Documentation expectations (from `web` row):** requires API contracts, data models, state management, UI components, deployment guidance.

## Notes
- Treated as a single part, so outputs will describe the entire repository rather than splitting into per-folder artifacts.
- Focus on connecting the UI, API, and Codex runner narratives in the final documentation outputs.
