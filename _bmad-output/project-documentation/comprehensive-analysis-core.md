# Comprehensive Analysis (core)

- **Project footprint**: Treated as one monolith combining the React/Vite UI (`AgentChain_UI`), ASP.NET 8 API (`AgentChain_API/againt_chain_api`), and Codex runner console app (`AgentChain_Codex/CodexRunner`).
- **Existing documentation**: Four sources (UI README, UI project-context, API project-architecture, API project-context) provide high-level vision but no unified index yet.
- **Key tech requirements**: Derived from the `web` documentation requirements row: API contracts, data models, state management, UI components, deployment guidelines, and integration architecture between UI/API/runner.
- **Quick-scan strategy**: No source file reading beyond manifest files; relied on `package.json`, `.csproj`, `Program.cs`, and exported text docs.
- **Action summary**: Generated classification artifacts, existing documentation inventory, state helpers, and technology/architecture summaries as the basis for the longer documentation build.
